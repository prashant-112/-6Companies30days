            1- A
            27- AA
            28- AB
            100- CV, not AAAC
            the pattern is like AA, AB, AC,.. AZ, BA, BB
            we can see that 100/26= 3 (C) and 100%3= 22 (V)
            thus we need to start calculating characters from right to left
            Also here, A=1 but in ascii A=65 
                 while Z= 26 but in ascii Z= 90
            therefore if we do n%26+65-1, for A we get 65 but for Z we get 64 which is wrong
                      so we'll need to do (n-1)%26+65 to get A=65 and Z= 90
