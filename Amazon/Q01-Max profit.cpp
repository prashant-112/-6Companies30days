        Observations:
        1 transaction is completed when stock is sold
        atmost K transactions 
        can buy next stock after selling previous stock only 
        
        Approach: Bottom Up
        1. dp[i][!own][k]: represents max profit we can make from day i to N 
                            such that we don't own any stock and have k transactions
        When we don't own any stock, we'll have 2 choices
        a. buy a stock : (-prices[])+dp[i+1][1][k]
        b. don't buy   :  dp[i+1][1][k]
        
        1. dp[i][own][k]: represents max profit we can make from day i to N 
                          such that we own a stock and have k transactions
        When we own any stock, we'll have 2 choices
        a. sell a stock : (prices[])+dp[i+1][0][k-1] 
                          if we have 1 or more transactions left [Transaction Completed]
        b. don't sell   :  dp[i+1][0][k] 
        
        Thus final ans would be value at dp[0][0][K] i.e 
        max profit we can get from day 0 to N such that we don't own 
        any stock now (transaction completed) and have used our K transactions
        
        TC: O(N*K)
        SC: O(N*K)
